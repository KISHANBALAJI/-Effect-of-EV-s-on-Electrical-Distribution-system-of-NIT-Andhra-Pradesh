The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) can significantly impact power distribution systems by disrupting supply-demand balance and straining substations. Our project aims to assess and predict these effects using machine learning, focusing on an 80% EV replacement scenario by 2030 within our institute. By integrating the load of charging stations into our distribution system, we will analyze potential challenges and develop strategies to mitigate them.
